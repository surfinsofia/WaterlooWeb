# Homework-1
    This is my first homework.
I made a website with different elements containing a variety of topics but mantaining the original format provided.
    "The Water Website" contains questions, answers, and everything in between. 
Join me through your screen,
your electrical machine
Keep Calm and Serene
and Welcome to The Water Website indeed.
